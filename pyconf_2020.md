#### Elevator Pitch:
##### Why is Data Driven Presentation very necessary ?
* `Automating Presentations`
    Modify the same slides for different audiences by automating them from data, instead of manually updating them.
* `Dynamic Insights`
    Reporting & Meeting slides use the same
    template, updated manually everytime with new data. Instead automate them based on a schedule or events.
* `Avoid Copy Paste`
    Managements needs presentations that combine data and narratives. Use PowerPoint automation directly to avoid it.

#### Description:
* This workshop explains how to create data driven presentations in Python.
* PowerPoint is the most popular tool for presenting data. With almost 1 billion users, PowerPoint is the largest medium to communicate data. (Source: Microsoft, ZDNet).
* Even BI Platform users copy-paste screenshots into PowerPoint. What if we could generate them natively ?
